* About

This is a readonly [[https://www.gnu.org/software/xorriso/][GNU xorriso]] based ISO9660 [[https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc/blob/master/src/vfs/extfs/helpers/README][plugin]] for Midnight Commander.

*Pros* compared to the classic ISO9660 plugin (the xorriso part of it):
- it is readonly, you cant mess your iso image with it
- it is fast on images containing lots of subdirs
- symlinks are visible
- the boot catalog file is visible
- dirs have actual modified date shown, not the current date

I [[https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc/pull/196][PR]]-ed the essentials of the code to the mc repository and it got merged on [[https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc/commit/49e2535c073b9eabf3396f22931441d3e4aa5908][May
18, 2024]].

* Installation

The code is based on the =xorriso= tool. In Ubuntu the package is named the
same.

*Notice*: Pathes used below are from Ubuntu. It might differ in your distro.

There are two relevant config files:
- global =/etc/mc/mc.ext= (*since 4.8.29*: =/etc/mc/mc.ext.ini=)
- local =~/.config/mc/mc.ext= (*since 4.8.29*: =~/.config/mc/mc.ext.ini=).

*The global config is not loaded if the local one exists.*

- search for =iso9660= and replace ~Open=%cd %p/iso9660://~ with ~Open=%cd
  %p/iso9660xl://~ there
- save it and exit the editor
- restart =mc= to apply the changes

** Global

- put the script under =/usr/lib/mc/extfs.d/= and make sure it is executable
- open =/etc/mc/mc.ext= (*since 4.8.29*: =/etc/mc/mc.ext.ini=) in some editor
- search for =iso9660= and replace ~Open=%cd %p/iso9660://~ with ~Open=%cd
